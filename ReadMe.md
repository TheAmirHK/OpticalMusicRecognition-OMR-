I love music and have always wanted to understand musical notes. Since Iâ€™ve been learning to play the piano, it became a necessity, so Iâ€™m diving into Python to explore and decode themðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¼. Itâ€™s an exciting journey, blending my passion for music with the power of coding!
A typical code should be started by:
1. Receiving the image and processing it to detect the notes.
2. Detecting the notes and symbols (i.e. noteheads, rests, clefs) from the processed image.
3. Classifying the symbols (i.e. noteheads, rests, clefs), since there are various types.
4. Mapping the recognized notes to their corresponding musical pitches and durations.

Note: I want to do more and convert the the map into music. I'll see what will happen. That's for future :)
